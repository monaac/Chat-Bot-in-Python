# Chat-Bot-in-Python
 a simple AI chatbot code in Python using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library


This code defines a simple chatbot that can respond to user input based on a set of pre-defined pairs of patterns and responses. The Chat class from the nltk.chat.util module is used to create the chatbot, and the converse() method is called to start the chatbot.

This is just a basic example, and you can add more patterns and responses to make the chatbot more sophisticated.
